# Dashboard
 This React.js project is a dynamic dashboard that provides real-time weather updates, cryptocurrency prices, and a live clock, all displayed on a visually appealing background. Using the OpenWeatherMap API, the application fetches and displays the current weather conditions for the user's location. Additionally, it integrates a Crypto API to track real-time cryptocurrency prices, such as Dogecoin, showing market trends at a glance. The background images are dynamically sourced from the Unsplash API, ensuring an ever-changing and aesthetically pleasing user experience. The project is built with React.js for seamless component-based architecture and CSS for modern, responsive styling. By leveraging multiple APIs, this dashboard effectively demonstrates how to integrate live data into a React application, making it both functional and engaging.
